# Interesting quirks in system prompts of coding agents

System prompts often expose a system’s engineering scars. Much like the small hacks that accumulate in a codebase to handle edge cases, bugs, or behavioral quirks, a model’s undesirable behaviors are frequently addressed with simple, corrective instructions in the system prompt. Over time, those fixes pile up, leaving a legacy prompt dotted with idiosyncratic patches. When someone new encounters it, they form conjectures around what underlying behaviour patch was trying to fix.

I’m going to walk through a few of these system-prompt patches in some coding agents and offer some conjectures about the underlying model behaviors they’re meant to address.

Anti-comment instructions are pretty universal, or at least, used to be. But I find it funny that the model was trying to talk to the user through comments. I guess we can’t blame it for learning this from humans.

Somewhere there's a doc titled "H1 Considered Harmful." I wonder if someone at Cursor ran experiments on heading sizes, concluded that `#` headings are emotionally overwhelming, and escalated this finding all the way into the system prompt.

The model is being *scolded* for hypothetical future forgetfulness. "Unacceptable" is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. Imagine your boss pre-scolding you: "If you don't use Jira, you will forget things, and THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE."

This is an actual example in the Claude Code system prompt, teaching the model to give short answers. But also... 150,000? That seems... high? Did they fact-check this? Is this prompt-engineer-verified Jetta-golf-ball science?

A coding CLI with a built-in sticker shipping form. And they had to add negative examples because the model was apparently trying to ship stickers to people who just wanted to *code* something about stickers. "I need a database schema for—" "DID SOMEONE SAY STICKERS? 📬"

Cursor devotes approximately 400 words across 4+ sections to telling the model to make parallel tool calls. They say it in normal text, then bold, then CAPS, then with examples, then with negative examples, then with a performance benchmark (3-5x!). This might be the single most reinforced instruction across all system prompts. The model REALLY wants to do things one at a time.
