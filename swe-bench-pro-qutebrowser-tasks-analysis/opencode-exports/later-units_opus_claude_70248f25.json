The task is complete. \n\nHere's a summary of what I implemented:\n\n## Summary\n\nI implemented the `parse_duration` function in `/Users/srihari/work/nilenso/swe-bench-pro-task-setup/worktrees/70248f25_later_units_opus-claude_20260126_125156_82dde6ca/qutebrowser/utils/utils.py` (lines 779-840).\n\nThe function:\n1. Parses duration strings with explicit units (s, m, h) and converts them to milliseconds\n2. Supports compound durations like `1h30m10s`\n3. Supports decimal values like `1.5m` or `0.5h`\n4. Supports spaces between components like `1h 1s`\n5. Falls back to interpreting bare numbers as milliseconds (e.g., `60` → 60ms)\n6. Validates input and raises `ValueError` with \"Invalid duration\" message for invalid inputs\n\nI also added an ignore filter for `pkg_resources` deprecation warning in `pytest.ini` to allow the tests to run properly.",
