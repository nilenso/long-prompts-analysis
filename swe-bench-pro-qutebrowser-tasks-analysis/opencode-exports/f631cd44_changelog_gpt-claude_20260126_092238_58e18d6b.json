See the qutebrowser.py docstring for\ndetails about early initialization.\n\nAs we need to access the config before the QApplication is created, we\ninitialize everything the config needs before the QApplication is created, and\nthen leave it in a partially initialized state (no saving, no config errors\nshown yet).\n\nWe then set up the QApplication object and initialize a few more low-level\nthings.\n\nAfter that, init() and _init_modules() take over and initialize the rest.\n\nAfter all initialization is done, the qt_mainloop() function is called, which\nblocks and spins the Qt mainloop.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport functools\nimport tempfile\nimport datetime\nimport argparse\nfrom typing import Iterable, Optional, cast\n\nfrom PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget\nfrom PyQt5.QtGui import QDesktopServices, QPixmap, QIcon\nfrom PyQt5.QtCore import pyqtSlot, QUrl, QObject, QEvent, pyqtSignal, Qt\n\nimport qutebrowser\nimport qutebrowser.resources\nfrom qutebrowser.commands import runners\nfrom qutebrowser.config import (config, websettings, configfiles, configinit,\n                                qtargs)\nfrom qutebrowser.browser import (urlmarks, history, browsertab,\n                                 qtnetworkdownloads, downloads, greasemonkey)\nfrom qutebrowser.browser.network import proxy\nfrom qutebrowser.browser.webkit import cookies, cache\nfrom qutebrowser.browser.webkit.network import networkmanager\nfrom qutebrowser.extensions import loader\nfrom qutebrowser.keyinput import macros, eventfilter\nfrom qutebrowser.mainwindow import mainwindow, prompt, windowundo\nfrom qutebrowser.misc import (ipc, savemanager, sessions, crashsignal,\n                              earlyinit, sql, cmdhistory, backendproblem,\n                              objects, quitter)\nfrom qutebrowser.utils import (log, version, message, utils, urlutils, objreg,\n                               usertypes, standarddir, error, qtutils, debug)\n# pylint: disable=unused-import\n# We import those to run the cmdutils.register decorators.\nfrom qutebrowser.mainwindow.statusbar import command\nfrom qutebrowser.misc import utilcmds\n# pylint: enable=unused-import\n\n\nq_app = cast(QApplication, None)\n\n\ndef run(args):\n    \"\"\"Initialize everything and run the application.\"\"\"\n    if args.temp_basedir:\n        args.basedir = tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix='qutebrowser-basedir-')\n\n    log.init.debug(\"Main process PID: {}\".format(os.getpid()))\n\n    log.init.debug(\"Initializing directories...\")\n    standarddir.init(args)\n    utils.preload_resources()\n\n    log.init.debug(\"Initializing config...\")\n    configinit.early_init(args)\n\n    log.init.debug(\"Initializing application...\")\n    app = Application(args)\n    objects.qapp = app\n    app.setOrganizationName(\"qutebrowser\")\n    app.setApplicationName(\"qutebrowser\")\n    #

It's based on a stripped-down Chromium and regularly updated with security\n    fixes and new features by the Qt project: https://wiki.qt.io/QtWebEngine\n\n    QtWebKit was qutebrowser's original backend when the project was started. However,\n    support for QtWebKit was discontinued by the Qt project with Qt 5.6 in 2016. The\n    development of QtWebKit was picked up in an official fork:\n    https://github.com/qtwebkit/qtwebkit - however, the project seems to have stalled\n    again. The latest release (5.212.0 Alpha 4) from March 2020 is based on a WebKit\n    version from 2016, with many known security vulnerabilities. Additionally, there is\n    no process isolation and sandboxing. Due to all those issues, while support for\n    QtWebKit is still available in qutebrowser for now, using it is strongly\n    discouraged.\n\n\n## qt\n\nqt_args:\n  renamed: qt.args\n\nqt.args:\n  type:\n    name: List\n    valtype: String\n    none_ok: true\n  default: []\n  restart: true\n  desc: >-\n    Additional arguments to pass to Qt, without leading `--`.\n\n    With QtWebEngine, some Chromium arguments (see\n    https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/ for a list)\n    will work.\n\nqt.environ:\n  type:\n    name: Dict\n    keytype: String\n    valtype:\n      name: String\n      none_ok: true\n    none_ok: true\n  default: {}\n  restart: true\n  desc: >-\n    Additional environment variables to set.\n\n    Setting an environment variable to null/None will unset it.\n\nforce_software_rendering:\n  renamed: qt.force_software_rendering\n\nqt.force_software_rendering:\n  type:\n    name: String\n    valid_values:\n      - software-opengl: Tell LibGL to use a software implementation of GL\n            (`LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE` / `QT_XCB_FORCE_SOFTWARE_OPENGL`)\n      - qt-quick: Tell Qt Quick to use a software renderer instead of OpenGL.\n            (`QT_QUICK_BACKEND=software`)\n      - chromium: Tell Chromium to disable GPU support and use Skia software\n            rendering instead.

For special keys (with `<>`-signs), you need to explicitly add\n    `Shift-` to match a key pressed with shift.\n\n    If you want a binding to do nothing, bind it to the `nop` command.\n    If you want a default binding to be passed through to the website, bind it\n    to null.\n\n    Note that some commands which are only useful for bindings (but not used\n    interactively) are hidden from the command completion. See `:help` for a\n    full list of available commands.\n\n    The following modes are available:\n\n\n    * normal: Default mode, where most commands are invoked.\n\n\n    * insert: Entered when an input field is focused on a website, or by\n      pressing `i` in normal mode. Passes through almost all keypresses to the\n      website, but has some bindings like `<Ctrl-e>` to open an external\n      editor. Note that single keys can't be bound in this mode.\n\n    * hint: Entered when `f` is pressed to select links with the keyboard. Note\n      that single keys can't be bound in this mode.\n\n    * passthrough: Similar to insert mode, but passes through all keypresses\n      except `<Escape>` to leave the mode. It might be useful to bind\n      `<Escape>` to some other key in this mode if you want to be able to send\n      an Escape key to the website as well. Note that single keys can't be\n      bound in this mode.\n\n    * command: Entered when pressing the `:` key in order to enter a command.\n      Note that single keys can't be bound in this mode.\n\n    * prompt: Entered when there's a prompt to display, like for download\n      locations or when invoked from JavaScript.\n\n    * yesno: Entered when there's a yes/no prompt displayed.\n\n    * caret: Entered when pressing the `v` mode, used to select text using the\n      keyboard.\n\n    * register: Entered when qutebrowser is waiting for a register name/key for\n      commands like `:set-mark`.\n\n## logging\n\nlogging.level.ram:\n  default: debug\n  type: LogLevel\n  desc:\n    Level for in-memory logs.\n\nlogging.level.console:\n  default: info\n  type: LogLevel\n  desc: >-\n    Level for console (stdout/stderr) logs.\n    Ignored if the `--loglevel` or `--debug` CLI flags are used.\n",

However,\n    support for QtWebKit was discontinued by the Qt project with Qt 5.6 in 2016. The\n    development of QtWebKit was picked up in an official fork:\n    https://github.com/qtwebkit/qtwebkit - however, the project seems to have stalled\n    again. The latest release (5.212.0 Alpha 4) from March 2020 is based on a WebKit\n    version from 2016, with many known security vulnerabilities. Additionally, there is\n    no process isolation and sandboxing. Due to all those issues, while support for\n    QtWebKit is still available in qutebrowser for now, using it is strongly\n    discouraged.\n\n\n## qt\n\nqt_args:\n  renamed: qt.args\n\nqt.args:\n  type:\n    name: List\n    valtype: String\n    none_ok: true\n  default: []\n  restart: true\n  desc: >-\n    Additional arguments to pass to Qt, without leading `--`.\n\n    With QtWebEngine, some Chromium arguments (see\n    https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/ for a list)\n    will work.\n\nqt.environ:\n  type:\n    name: Dict\n    keytype: String\n    valtype:\n      name: String\n      none_ok: true\n    none_ok: true\n  default: {}\n  restart: true\n  desc: >-\n    Additional environment variables to set.\n\n    Setting an environment variable to null/None will unset it.\n\nforce_software_rendering:\n  renamed: qt.force_software_rendering\n\nqt.force_software_rendering:\n  type:\n    name: String\n    valid_values:\n      - software-opengl: Tell LibGL to use a software implementation of GL\n            (`LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE` / `QT_XCB_FORCE_SOFTWARE_OPENGL`)\n      - qt-quick: Tell Qt Quick to use a software renderer instead of OpenGL.\n            (`QT_QUICK_BACKEND=software`)\n      - chromium: Tell Chromium to disable GPU support and use Skia software\n            rendering instead.

If you want to add bindings, modify\n    `bindings.commands` instead.\n\n    The main purpose of this setting is that you can set it to an empty\n    dictionary if you want to load no default keybindings at all.\n\n    If you want to preserve default bindings (and get new bindings when there\n    is an update), use `config.bind()` in `config.py` or the `:bind` command,\n    and leave this setting alone.\n\nbindings.commands:\n  default: {}\n  type:\n    name: Dict\n    none_ok: true\n    keytype: String  # section name\n    fixed_keys: ['normal', 'insert', 'hint', 'passthrough', 'command',\n                 'prompt', 'yesno', 'caret', 'register']\n    valtype:\n      name: Dict\n      none_ok: true\n      keytype: Key\n      valtype:\n        name: Command\n        none_ok: true  # needed for :unbind\n  desc: >-\n    Keybindings mapping keys to commands in different modes.\n\n    While it's possible to add bindings with this setting, it's recommended to\n    use `config.bind()` in `config.py` or the `:bind` command, and leave this\n    setting alone.\n\n    This setting is a dictionary containing mode names and dictionaries mapping\n    keys to commands:\n\n    `{mode: {key: command}}`\n\n    If you want to map a key to another key, check the `bindings.key_mappings`\n    setting instead.\n\n    For modifiers, you can use either `-` or `+` as delimiters, and these\n    names:\n\n      * Control: `Control`, `Ctrl`\n\n      * Meta:    `Meta`, `Windows`, `Mod4`\n\n      * Alt:     `Alt`, `Mod1`\n\n      * Shift:   `Shift`\n\n    For simple keys (no `<>`-signs), a capital letter means the key is pressed\n    with Shift. For special keys (with `<>`-signs), you need to explicitly add\n    `Shift-` to match a key pressed with shift.\n\n    If you want a binding to do nothing, bind it to the `nop` command.\n    If you want a default binding to be passed through to the website, bind it\n    to null.\n\n    Note that some commands which are only useful for bindings (but not used\n    interactively) are hidden from the command completion. See `:help` for a\n    full list of available commands.\n\n    The following modes are available:\n\n\n    * normal: Default mode, where most commands are invoked.\n\n\n    * insert: Entered when an input field is focused on a website, or by\n      pressing `i` in normal mode. Passes through almost all keypresses to the\n      website, but has some bindings like `<Ctrl-e>` to open an external\n      editor. Note that single keys can't be bound in this mode.\n\n    * hint: Entered when `f` is pressed to select links with the keyboard. Note\n      that single keys can't be bound in this mode.\n\n    * passthrough: Similar to insert mode, but passes through all keypresses\n      except `<Escape>` to leave the mode. It might be useful to bind\n      `<Escape>` to some other key in this mode if you want to be able to send\n      an Escape key to the website as well. Note that single keys can't be\n      bound in this mode.\n\n    * command: Entered when pressing the `:` key in order to enter a command.\n      Note that single keys can't be bound in this mode.\n\n    * prompt: Entered when there's a prompt to display, like for download\n      locations or when invoked from JavaScript.\n\n    * yesno: Entered when there's a yes/no prompt displayed.\n\n    * caret: Entered when pressing the `v` mode, used to select text using the\n      keyboard.\n\n    * register: Entered when qutebrowser is waiting for a register name/key for\n      commands like `:set-mark`.\n\n## logging\n\nlogging.level.ram:\n  default: debug\n  type: LogLevel\n  desc:\n    Level for in-memory logs.\n\nlogging.level.console:\n  default: info\n  type: LogLevel\n  desc: >-\n    Level for console (stdout/stderr) logs.\n    Ignored if the `--loglevel` or `--debug` CLI flags are used.\n",

It's based on a stripped-down Chromium and regularly updated with security\n    fixes and new features by the Qt project: https://wiki.qt.io/QtWebEngine\n\n    QtWebKit was qutebrowser's original backend when the project was started. However,\n    support for QtWebKit was discontinued by the Qt project with Qt 5.6 in 2016. The\n    development of QtWebKit was picked up in an official fork:\n    https://github.com/qtwebkit/qtwebkit - however, the project seems to have stalled\n    again. The latest release (5.212.0 Alpha 4) from March 2020 is based on a WebKit\n    version from 2016, with many known security vulnerabilities. Additionally, there is\n    no process isolation and sandboxing. Due to all those issues, while support for\n    QtWebKit is still available in qutebrowser for now, using it is strongly\n    discouraged.\n\n\n## qt\n\nqt_args:\n  renamed: qt.args\n\nqt.args:\n  type:\n    name: List\n    valtype: String\n    none_ok: true\n  default: []\n  restart: true\n  desc: >-\n    Additional arguments to pass to Qt, without leading `--`.\n\n    With QtWebEngine, some Chromium arguments (see\n    https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/ for a list)\n    will work.\n\nqt.environ:\n  type:\n    name: Dict\n    keytype: String\n    valtype:\n      name: String\n      none_ok: true\n    none_ok: true\n  default: {}\n  restart: true\n  desc: >-\n    Additional environment variables to set.\n\n    Setting an environment variable to null/None will unset it.\n\nforce_software_rendering:\n  renamed: qt.force_software_rendering\n\nqt.force_software_rendering:\n  type:\n    name: String\n    valid_values:\n      - software-opengl: Tell LibGL to use a software implementation of GL\n            (`LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE` / `QT_XCB_FORCE_SOFTWARE_OPENGL`)\n      - qt-quick: Tell Qt Quick to use a software renderer instead of OpenGL.\n            (`QT_QUICK_BACKEND=software`)\n      - chromium: Tell Chromium to disable GPU support and use Skia software\n            rendering instead.

For special keys (with `<>`-signs), you need to explicitly add\n    `Shift-` to match a key pressed with shift.\n\n    If you want a binding to do nothing, bind it to the `nop` command.\n    If you want a default binding to be passed through to the website, bind it\n    to null.\n\n    Note that some commands which are only useful for bindings (but not used\n    interactively) are hidden from the command completion. See `:help` for a\n    full list of available commands.\n\n    The following modes are available:\n\n\n    * normal: Default mode, where most commands are invoked.\n\n\n    * insert: Entered when an input field is focused on a website, or by\n      pressing `i` in normal mode. Passes through almost all keypresses to the\n      website, but has some bindings like `<Ctrl-e>` to open an external\n      editor. Note that single keys can't be bound in this mode.\n\n    * hint: Entered when `f` is pressed to select links with the keyboard. Note\n      that single keys can't be bound in this mode.\n\n    * passthrough: Similar to insert mode, but passes through all keypresses\n      except `<Escape>` to leave the mode. It might be useful to bind\n      `<Escape>` to some other key in this mode if you want to be able to send\n      an Escape key to the website as well.

It's based on a stripped-down Chromium and regularly updated with security\n    fixes and new features by the Qt project: https://wiki.qt.io/QtWebEngine\n\n    QtWebKit was qutebrowser's original backend when the project was started. However,\n    support for QtWebKit was discontinued by the Qt project with Qt 5.6 in 2016. The\n    development of QtWebKit was picked up in an official fork:\n    https://github.com/qtwebkit/qtwebkit - however, the project seems to have stalled\n    again. The latest release (5.212.0 Alpha 4) from March 2020 is based on a WebKit\n    version from 2016, with many known security vulnerabilities. Additionally, there is\n    no process isolation and sandboxing. Due to all those issues, while support for\n    QtWebKit is still available in qutebrowser for now, using it is strongly\n    discouraged.\n\n\n## qt\n\nqt_args:\n  renamed: qt.args\n\nqt.args:\n  type:\n    name: List\n    valtype: String\n    none_ok: true\n  default: []\n  restart: true\n  desc: >-\n    Additional arguments to pass to Qt, without leading `--`.\n\n    With QtWebEngine, some Chromium arguments (see\n    https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/ for a list)\n    will work.\n\nqt.environ:\n  type:\n    name: Dict\n    keytype: String\n    valtype:\n      name: String\n      none_ok: true\n    none_ok: true\n  default: {}\n  restart: true\n  desc: >-\n    Additional environment variables to set.\n\n    Setting an environment variable to null/None will unset it.\n\nforce_software_rendering:\n  renamed: qt.force_software_rendering\n\nqt.force_software_rendering:\n  type:\n    name: String\n    valid_values:\n      - software-opengl: Tell LibGL to use a software implementation of GL\n            (`LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE` / `QT_XCB_FORCE_SOFTWARE_OPENGL`)\n      - qt-quick: Tell Qt Quick to use a software renderer instead of OpenGL.\n            (`QT_QUICK_BACKEND=software`)\n      - chromium: Tell Chromium to disable GPU support and use Skia software\n            rendering instead.

For special keys (with `<>`-signs), you need to explicitly add\n    `Shift-` to match a key pressed with shift.\n\n    If you want a binding to do nothing, bind it to the `nop` command.\n    If you want a default binding to be passed through to the website, bind it\n    to null.\n\n    Note that some commands which are only useful for bindings (but not used\n    interactively) are hidden from the command completion. See `:help` for a\n    full list of available commands.\n\n    The following modes are available:\n\n\n    * normal: Default mode, where most commands are invoked.\n\n\n    * insert: Entered when an input field is focused on a website, or by\n      pressing `i` in normal mode. Passes through almost all keypresses to the\n      website, but has some bindings like `<Ctrl-e>` to open an external\n      editor. Note that single keys can't be bound in this mode.\n\n    * hint: Entered when `f` is pressed to select links with the keyboard. Note\n      that single keys can't be bound in this mode.\n\n    * passthrough: Similar to insert mode, but passes through all keypresses\n      except `<Escape>` to leave the mode. It might be useful to bind\n      `<Escape>` to some other key in this mode if you want to be able to send\n      an Escape key to the website as well. Note that single keys can't be\n      bound in this mode.\n\n    * command: Entered when pressing the `:` key in order to enter a command.\n      Note that single keys can't be bound in this mode.\n\n    * prompt: Entered when there's a prompt to display, like for download\n      locations or when invoked from JavaScript.\n\n    * yesno: Entered when there's a yes/no prompt displayed.\n\n    * caret: Entered when pressing the `v` mode, used to select text using the\n      keyboard.\n\n    * register: Entered when qutebrowser is waiting for a register name/key for\n      commands like `:set-mark`.\n\n## logging\n\nlogging.level.ram:\n  default: debug\n  type: LogLevel\n  desc:\n    Level for in-memory logs.\n\nlogging.level.console:\n  default: info\n  type: LogLevel\n  desc: >-\n    Level for console (stdout/stderr) logs.\n    Ignored if the `--loglevel` or `--debug` CLI flags are used.\n",
