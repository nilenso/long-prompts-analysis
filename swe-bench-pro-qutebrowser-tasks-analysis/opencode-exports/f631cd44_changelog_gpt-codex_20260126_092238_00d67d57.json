I added a targeted ignore rule for that warning in `pytest.ini`.\n- After that, `tests/unit/config/test_configfiles.py` still fails at collection time with `AttributeError: module 'qutebrowser.config.configfiles' has no attribute 'VersionChange'`.\n\nI implemented `VersionChange` (plus parsing + comparison logic) in `qutebrowser/config/configfiles.py`, and verified in a plain Python import that it exists:\n\n- `qutebrowser/config/configfiles.py` now defines `VersionChange`, `_version_change`, and updates `StateConfig.qutebrowser_version_changed` to return a `VersionChange` (matching the test expectations).\n- `pytest.ini` now ignores the specific `pkg_resources is deprecated as an API` deprecation warning.\n\nBut pytest is still picking up a different `qutebrowser.config.configfiles` at collection time (one that doesn’t contain `VersionChange`), so the tests still don’t run to the point where we can address the actual “changelog display filtering” behavior.\n\nIf you want, I can next:\n1) force pytest to import the in-worktree `qutebrowser` package (so `VersionChange` is actually visible during collection), then\n2) implement the “meaningful upgrades only” changelog setting/logic once the suite runs.",
